Unfortunately, I am completely dissatisfied with my performance and would like to explain to you why my technical test turned out so badly.

# 1. Handling of "useState" and "useEffect":

I decided to start with the React app at the beginning, even though I had no experience with developing in this framework. However, I quickly encountered problems because even after updating a variable via the second parameter of the useState function, the variable still had the old value. This meant that I could not use the saved API data directly and updating the questions did not work either.

# 2. The non-communication

The problem described in the first point caused a lot of follow-up problems, which cost me a lot of time. I probably should have written to you briefly about this so that I wouldn't have lost so much time on this problem.

# 3. My PHP experience

Unfortunately, besides my React experience, my PHP experience is also very limited. When creating widgets for a CMS, I have not yet had to deal with dynamic content, which is why, after a quick look at the first task, I decided to start with the second task. Unfortunately, I was not able to finish this task, so I did not have time to look at the PHP API task in detail.

So overall, I am unfortunately very aware that my performance was poor. I already had this fear before the test, as I have no real experience in either PHP or React.

If it were possible I would very much like to take another coding test in JS/Angular. I firmly believe that I could quickly learn both PHP and React. I hope that in our interview last week and in the video recordings I was able to show that I already have a comprehensive understanding of technology and development, so you will give me another chance.
